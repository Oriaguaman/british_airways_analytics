# british_airways_analytics

This repository contains a data science project that explores how data analytics can contribute to British Airways' success. The project involves analyzing customer reviews and building a predictive model to understand the factors influencing customer booking behavior.

Project Overview
In this project, we performed the following tasks:

Customer Review Analysis:

Scraped customer reviews from online sources using BeautifulSoup.

Analyzed sentiments and key themes within the reviews to understand customer satisfaction and pain points.

Predictive Modeling:

Built a predictive model to forecast customer bookings based on historical data.

Analyzed various factors such as flight duration, booking source, customer demographics, and additional services requested (e.g., extra baggage, preferred seat).

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-Learn

BeautifulSoup

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Key Steps
1. Data Collection:
Scraped customer review data using BeautifulSoup to gather insights on customer sentiments.

Extracted relevant features from British Airways' historical booking data.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned and transformed the data for analysis.

Dealt with missing values, outliers, and categorical data encoding.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed trends, distributions, and correlations between different variables.

Visualized customer satisfaction and booking patterns to uncover insights.

4. Model Building:
Implemented machine learning algorithms to predict customer bookings.

Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Insights & Reporting:
Identified key factors that influence customer booking decisions.

Created visualizations to showcase findings and suggest actionable insights.
